TODO
- explainations for the config paths
eg.: 'node.storageType' - defines the nodes storage type...
'debug.startAtCurrentBlock' - does xyz
its then up to the user to impl a config that houses those props 
- TODONEW for things that need to be refactored but should wait for other stuff to be completed/ working first
